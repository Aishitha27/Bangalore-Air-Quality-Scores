# Tracking and Evaluating Air Quality Trends in Bangalore

Air pollution is the 2nd leading risk factor for death and the leading environmental contributor to death worldwide, contributing to more than 8 million deaths in 2021 **1**. Up to 99% of us are breathing polluted air **2**, cutting lives short by an average of 1.9 years across the globe **3**. As a living being on this planet it is our right to access healthy air around us that doesn't poison or make us sick.

Air pollution imapcts us in every minute way possible that is invisible to out unaided eyes. It results in birth defects to respiratory illnesses.

I took up this project because I am passionate about studying and advocating for healthy and clean environment which is every living beings birth right including the plants and trees that surround us. I am a firm beleiver of  **'We do not inherit the Earth from our ancestors; we borrow it from our children'**. I being brought up in Banaglore, which is a cosmopolitan city and silicon valley of India, I wanted to understand the air quality and teh current states of teh city with access to the data which had gap before beacue there were any data publicy accessible. Reliable data on air pollution are fundamental to understanding and taking corrective action to improve air quality. Air quality data underpin all actions on air pollution. They tell us how much pollution is in the air we breathe.
 
This project demonstartes the fetching and evaluating air quality data for Bangalore, India, across multiple years. By calculating a weighted air quality score and categorizing it into quality labels, the project aims to provide a comparative assessment of air quality trends across different locations in the city, which could help people living in it make wise choice about living in or moving out of certain areas wihting the city based on the quality of air they are breathing.

We fetch the data for this project from OpenAQ platform.

OpenAQ is an open-source, open-access data platform that aggregates and harmonizes open air quality data from across the globe and gives unfettered access to the data needed to analyze, communicate and advocate for clean air. We access the data through OpenAQ's API.

The air quality parameters collected from sensors deployed across Bangalore were a few, and not equally collected across all the areas and years. Hence, we boil down to the following key parameters to conduct evaluation :

**1. Carbon Monoxide (CO)**
**2. Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)**
**3. Sulfur Dioxide (SO2)**
**4. Particulate Matter (PM2.5)**
